### Predicting whether a DNA sequence belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)

## Introduction
The goal of the data challenge is to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms, understand them, and adapt them to structural data.
For this reason, we were given a sequence classification task: to predict whether a DNA sequence (or read) belongs to SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19).

## Data description
The training and evaluation data are sets of DNA sequencing reads: short DNA fragments (~100-300 bp long), which come from sequencing experiments, or have been simulated from complete genomes. Some of these fragments come from Covid-19 genomes, others from humans or random bacteria.
The objective is to discriminate Covid-19 fragments, hence a binary classification task: the labels are either 1 if the fragment is identified as Covid-19, or 0 otherwise.
